            <h2></h2>
            <p class="fotoaltıyazı"><span class="hello">Hello</span>, after working in the field of Civil Engineering for three years, I have come to the realization that a role involving working closely with technology would be a better fit for me. I am interested in pursuing a career as a software consultant within SAP's extensive product range. In addition to my communication, project management, crisis management, and decision-making skills acquired through working closely with people, I also believe that my professional knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3, DApps and Python programming languages will enable me to make a difference in this field.</p>

                <h3>History and Strategy</h3>
                <p>I have always enjoyed following fantasy literature since my childhood. I like to research and read about history and watch documentaries, especially about the period of World War II. I love to strategize, so I play computer games such as Europa Universalis 4, Hearts of Iron 4, Age of Empires 4, and Dota 2.</p>

                <h3>Chess and Economy</h3>
                <p>Since my childhood, I have been interested in many different fields. Chess is one of them, and in 2018, I became a champion among about 120 players in Ankara. Since I can remember, I have been interested in the stock market and economics. I have been investing in the stock market for about 7 years now.</p>
